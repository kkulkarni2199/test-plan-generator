Induced interfering voltages in both  conductors have the same polarity and amplitude; the wanted differential mode signal remains  unaffected up to certain frequencies. The interference appears as an unwanted common mode signal.  Depending on its common mode rejection ratio, the correct operation of connected equipment is  influenced by the presence of common mode voltages;"

At high frequencies the method of grounding of the screen at the cable  ends is very important. Even a few centimetres of unscreened lead (pigtail) can compromise the screen  effectiveness."
