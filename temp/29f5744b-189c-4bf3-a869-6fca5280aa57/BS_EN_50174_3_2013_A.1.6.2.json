To  overcome it, a short circuit loop made of high conductive metal (such as copper) could compensate in a good  part this field and thus overcome the disturbing situation). Other countermeasures could be taken e.g. at the  \"sink\" side (see Example 1). The last possibility is to change the installation in such a way that no magnetic  fields are created."
