Other mounting techniques can require proper screening of cables to assure their electromagnetic  separation. Inputs and outputs of filters should be arranged as far apart as possible; leads from the input and  output side shall never be in the same bundle. Filtered leads should never encounter the unfiltered ones to  minimise coupling effects."

Poor mounting of an otherwise good filter  will produce poor filtering. The filter earth connection impedance should be as low as possible to avoid the  generation of disturbances that would otherwise be applied in common mode to the apparatus to be  protected. See Figure A.6 for an example."
